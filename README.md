# Disclosure:
This is a fork of gamescomputersplay/monopoly.
This version will have changes to the original.

# Intro:
After watching the video What's the probability of an endless Monopoly game? (simulating 1.000.000 games in Python) [1] I wanted to ckeck the code. The original author didnt implement auctions witch seemed to me an important factor and I'm interested in checking how the results will be altered.
